# Consumer and Queue Management Separation

## Overview

Successfully separated consumer management from queue management for better code organization and maintainability.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Files Created

#### `controllers/consumerController.js`

-   Extracted all consumer-related methods from `queueController.js`
-   Handles consumer lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
-   Manages consumer status and health monitoring
-   Handles worker statistics and management
-   Uses proper error handling with `ErrorHandler.wrapAsync`

#### `routes/consumerRoutes.js`

-   New dedicated routes for consumer management
-   Clean separation of concerns
-   Organized route grouping:
    -   General consumer management
    -   Specific consumer management
    -   Worker management and statistics

### 2. Modified Files

#### `controllers/queueController.js`

-   Removed consumer-related imports and methods
-   Now focuses only on queue operations:
    -   Queue statistics and health
    -   Queue purging operations
    -   Dead letter queue retry
    -   Test message publishing
    -   Connection details

#### `routes/queueRoutes.js`

-   Removed all consumer-related routes
-   Clean focus on queue operations only
-   Reduced file complexity

#### `app.js`

-   Added import for new `consumerRoutes`
-   Mounted consumer routes at `/consumers` path
-   Maintains existing `/queue` path for queue operations

#### `docs/CONSUMER_MANAGEMENT.md`

-   Updated all API endpoint URLs
-   Changed from `/queue/consumers/*` to `/consumers/*`
-   Updated usage examples with correct URLs

### 3. URL Structure Changes

#### Before (Mixed):

```
/queue/consumers/status          → Consumer status
/queue/consumers/health          → Consumer health
/queue/consumers/start           → Start all consumers
/queue/consumers/stop            → Stop all consumers
/queue/consumers/restart         → Restart all consumers
/queue/consumers/available       → Available queues
/queue/consumers/:queueName/*    → Specific consumer operations
/queue/workers/stats             → Worker statistics
/queue/stats                     → Queue statistics
/queue/health                    → Queue health
```

#### After (Separated):

```
# Consumer Management
/consumers/status                → Consumer status
/consumers/health                → Consumer health
/consumers/start                 → Start all consumers
/consumers/stop                  → Stop all consumers
/consumers/restart               → Restart all consumers
/consumers/available             → Available queues
/consumers/:queueName/*          → Specific consumer operations
/consumers/workers/stats         → Worker statistics

# Queue Management
/queue/stats                     → Queue statistics
/queue/health                    → Queue health
/queue/purge/:queueName          → Purge specific queue
/queue/purge-all                 → Purge all queues
/queue/retry-dlq                 → Retry dead letter messages
/queue/test/publish              → Test message publishing
/queue/connection/details        → Connection details
```

## Benefits

### 1. Better Organization

-   Clear separation of concerns
-   Easier to locate specific functionality
-   Reduced file complexity

### 2. Improved Maintainability

-   Consumer logic isolated in dedicated files
-   Queue logic focused on queue operations only
-   Easier to modify either system independently

### 3. Better API Design

-   More intuitive URL structure
-   Logical grouping of related endpoints
-   Cleaner API documentation

### 4. Scalability

-   Easier to add new consumer features
-   Easier to add new queue features
-   Better code reuse possibilities

## Testing Results

### ✅ All Endpoints Working

-   **Queue Operations**: All `/queue/*` endpoints functional
-   **Consumer Operations**: All `/consumers/*` endpoints functional
-   **Specific Consumer Management**: Individual consumer control working
-   **Worker Management**: Statistics and reset functionality working

### ✅ No Breaking Changes

-   Server starts successfully
-   All existing functionality preserved
-   Error handling maintained
-   Response formats unchanged

### ✅ Documentation Updated

-   API documentation reflects new URL structure
-   Usage examples updated
-   Clear separation documented

## Migration Notes

For existing API consumers, update URLs from:

-   `/queue/consumers/*` → `/consumers/*`
-   `/queue/workers/*` → `/consumers/workers/*`

Queue-specific operations remain at `/queue/*` unchanged.

## Code Quality

### ✅ Maintainability Improved

-   Single Responsibility Principle followed
-   Clear separation of concerns
-   Reduced coupling between queue and consumer logic

### ✅ Error Handling Consistent

-   All controllers use `ErrorHandler.wrapAsync`
-   Consistent error response format
-   Proper validation and error propagation

### ✅ Documentation Complete

-   All files properly documented
-   API documentation updated
-   Migration guidance provided

This refactoring successfully separates consumer and queue management while maintaining full functionality and improving code organization.
