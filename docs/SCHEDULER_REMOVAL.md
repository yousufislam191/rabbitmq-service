# Scheduler Removal Summary

## Overview

All scheduler-related code has been removed from the project as requested. The system now operates purely on-demand without automatic cron-based processing.

## Files Removed

-   `schedulers/migrationScheduler.js` - Main scheduler implementation
-   `schedulers/` directory - Empty directory removed

## Code Changes Made

### 1. app.js

**Removed:**

-   Import statement: `const startScheduler = require("./schedulers/migrationScheduler");`
-   Comment: "Start consumers and scheduler"
-   Commented code: `// startScheduler();`

**Updated to:**

-   Clean import statements without scheduler reference
-   Simplified startup comments and flow

### 2. config/index.js

**Removed:**

-   `CRON_SCHEDULE: process.env.CRON_SCHEDULE || "*/10 * * * *"`
-   `ENABLE_SCHEDULER: process.env.ENABLE_SCHEDULER !== "false"`

### 3. package.json

**Removed:**

-   Dependency: `"node-cron": "^4.2.0"`
-   Updated description to remove scheduler references

### 4. jobs/migrateDataJob.js

**Updated:**

-   Changed message source from `"scheduler"` to `"migration-job"` in headers

## Impact Assessment

### âœ… What Still Works

-   **Manual Migrations**: All migration endpoints still function
-   **Queue Processing**: RabbitMQ consumers continue to process messages
-   **API Endpoints**: All REST API functionality remains intact
-   **Worker Processing**: Background workers still handle batch operations
-   **Database Operations**: All database operations unchanged

### ðŸ”„ What Changed

-   **No Automatic Processing**: System no longer automatically processes pending/failed documents
-   **On-Demand Only**: Migrations must be triggered manually via API endpoints
-   **Simplified Startup**: Application startup is now faster and simpler

## Migration Workflow (Post-Scheduler)

### Before (With Scheduler)

1. Scheduler runs every 10 minutes
2. Automatically processes pending documents
3. Automatically retries failed documents
4. Automatically completes processing documents

### After (Manual Only)

1. Use API endpoints to trigger migrations:

    ```bash
    # Start migration for pending documents
    POST /api/migration/start

    # Retry failed documents
    POST /api/migration/retry-failed

    # Complete processing documents
    POST /api/migration/complete-processing
    ```

## Recommended Migration Triggers

Since automatic scheduling is removed, consider these alternatives:

### 1. External Cron Jobs

Set up system-level cron jobs to call your API endpoints:

```bash
# Every 10 minutes - process pending documents
*/10 * * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/migration/start

# Every 30 minutes - retry failed documents
*/30 * * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/migration/retry-failed
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Triggers

Integrate migration calls into your deployment pipeline

### 3. Manual Dashboard

Create a management dashboard with buttons to trigger migrations

### 4. Webhook Integration

Set up webhooks from other systems to trigger migrations

## Environment Variables No Longer Used

-   `CRON_SCHEDULE` - Previously controlled cron timing
-   `ENABLE_SCHEDULER` - Previously enabled/disabled scheduler

## Benefits of Removal

-   **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer moving parts to maintain
-   **Better Control**: Explicit control over when migrations run
-   **Reduced Dependencies**: One less npm package to manage
-   **Cleaner Startup**: Faster application startup
-   **Easier Testing**: No background processes interfering with tests

## Next Steps

1. **Remove node-cron package**: Run `npm uninstall node-cron` if desired
2. **Update Documentation**: Update any deployment docs mentioning scheduler
3. **Set Up Alternative Triggers**: Implement external triggers as needed
4. **Update Monitoring**: Adjust monitoring to expect manual migrations only

The system is now purely API-driven and ready for external orchestration as needed.
